Incorporated in 2020 under the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) with Registration Number CAC/TT/NO 153360, SHF is committed to bridging societal gaps and maximizing potential to foster social change. The foundation’s mission focuses on enhancing health and well-being, promoting quality education, and broadening economic empowerment opportunities for the underprivileged across Africa and beyond.",
    origin:`The foundation's journey began in 2015, spearheaded by its founder, Prince Telvin Ugochukwu Onuorah, following his graduation from university and completion of the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) in Nigeria. After pursuing higher education abroad, earning master’s and doctorate degrees in Accounting and Finance, Prince Telvin was inspired to give back. Witnessing widespread hardship, he started funding school fees for hundreds of individuals across Africa.

    In December 2017, he celebrated Christmas at the National Hospital in Kampala, Uganda, where he paid off medical debts for hospitalized citizens, offered prayers, and encouraged steadfastness in faith. This act of kindness exemplified his unwavering commitment to helping others. Despite encountering challenges, Prince Telvin remains dedicated to his mission of uplifting the less privileged.
    
    Prince Telvin's philanthropic spirit is rooted in his upbringing, heavily influenced by his father, H.R.H. Igwe M. O. Onuorah, the paramount ruler of Agbogugu Community in Enugu State, Nigeria. Known for his generosity and leadership, Igwe Onuorah’s legacy of giving has deeply inspired the foundation’s activities.`,
